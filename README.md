# event-management-system
A full-featured Event Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Features include user authentication, event creation, image uploads, RSVP system, and category-based event filtering.


Project Overview / Specifications

The College Event Management System is a full-stack web application developed using the
MERN Stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It is designed to help students,
faculty, and administrators manage events in a college environment.
Core features of the system include:
● Student login/signup

● Browse and search for events

● Admin panel to add/update/delete events

● Image upload for event posters/banners

● Notification/reminders for upcoming events

This project promotes transparency, improves student engagement, and automates repetitive
administrative tasks in organizing college events.



Proposed System
The proposed Event Management System addresses the shortcomings of the existing systems by
introducing a unified web-based platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
React.js, and Node.js).

Key improvements of the proposed system:
● User Authentication: Secure login/signup system for students and admins.

● Event Management: Admin can create, update, and delete events with images, dates,
and categories.

● Student Interaction: Students can register for events directly through the portal.

● Filtering & Search: Events can be filtered by type (technical, cultural, etc.) or searched
by keywords.

● Real-time Notifications: Reminders and updates for upcoming or updated events.

● Mobile Compatibility: Fully responsive UI for accessibility on laptops and mobile
devices.

● Data Centralization: All event details, registrations, and feedback stored in one place.





Feasibility Study

A feasibility study was conducted to assess the viability of the proposed system in terms of
technical, operational, and economic factors.
Technical Feasibility:

● The project uses widely adopted and well-supported technologies (React, Node,
MongoDB).

● The development environment is compatible with most college-provided systems.

● The MERN stack offers scalable and maintainable architecture.
Operational Feasibility:

● The system will simplify event registration and reduce the workload of faculty and
student coordinators.

● Training requirements are minimal due to the user-friendly interface.

● Can be adopted across all departments and clubs within the college.
Economic Feasibility:

● All technologies used are open-source and free to use.

● The hosting cost is minimal if using free-tier services or college-hosted servers.

● Saves recurring administrative costs involved in printing, manual entry, and
announcements




Design and Test Steps / Criteria for EMS
3.3 Algorithms
Algorithm Design Steps:

● Define the Problem:

○ The problem is to streamline and automate college event management, including
registration, scheduling, and feedback collection.

● Choose the Right Algorithm:

○ For event registration: Use an efficient sorting algorithm (like MergeSort or
QuickSort) to order participant data.

○ For scheduling: Implement a scheduling algorithm that handles resource
allocation and avoids conflicts (e.g., Greedy Algorithm or Constraint Satisfaction
Problems).

● Design the Algorithm:

○ Event Registration Algorithm:

■ Allow participants to sign up for events.

■ Ensure each registration is unique, and confirmation emails are
automatically sent.

○ Scheduling Algorithm:
■ Create a mechanism to manage event schedules, avoiding resource
conflicts.

● Implement the Algorithm:

○ Write the code to manage user registration, event scheduling, and notifications in
the backend using Node.js and Express.js.

● Validate the Algorithm:

○ Test event registration to ensure users cannot register for multiple overlapping
events.

○ Test the schedule algorithm to avoid conflicts (e.g., venue, time clashes).

○ Ensure the notification system works in real-time.

● Optimize the Algorithm:

○ Optimize for database queries (e.g., prevent excessive queries when fetching
events or registration data).

● Document the Algorithm:

○ Document the event registration flow, scheduling logic, and notification process.

● Review and Refactor:

○ Regularly check the efficiency of the algorithms and refactor them as necessary.
